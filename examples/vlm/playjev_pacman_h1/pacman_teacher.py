"""Pac-Man teacher (games/pacman, daleharvey/pacman).

Algorithm, in three lines:
1. Ghosts are memoryless random walkers with an exactly known rule (turn at every 4-way, 50/50 at a T, never
   reverse, one block per 5 ticks). Propagate each dangerous ghost's occupancy distribution over (cell, direction)
   for 45 ticks; a cell is unsafe for Pac-Man at time t if a ghost can be at it within 5 ticks of t, or can cross
   it 6 to 7 ticks before or after at right angles to Pac-Man's move (collision radius is one block, and the closest
   approach of two perpendicular movers is k/sqrt2); a ghost moving in Pac-Man's direction one block ahead never
   closes and is exempt.
2. For each pressable direction, BFS from Pac-Man's next grid square over cells that are safe at Pac-Man's own
   arrival time, honouring the step granularity (an in-step reversal carries straight through the cell behind).
   The value is the time to the nearest pellet or power pill, or to an edible ghost when the remaining edible time
   allows (worth 50/100/150/200, so a detour of value/5 ticks is accepted); reversals cost 4 ticks extra. A
   direction only counts if its safe region reaches past the ghost horizon (no walking into a dead-end trap).
3. Soft target: 0.9 on the best direction(s), 0.1 spread over other directions that are pressable and safe, zero
   on walls, stops and moves into a ghost. With no safe route to a pellet, take the deepest safe region; with no
   safe first step, the direction that meets the ghost latest.

info() from games/pacman/pj_hook.js: map rows joined by '|' ('#' wall, '=' ghost house, '.' pellet, 'o' power
pill, ' ' empty), pac {x, y, dir} in block units (tenths of a block resolution), ghosts [{x, y, dir, vulnerable,
eaten}], tick, level, pellets, pills. Row 10 wraps: x = -1 and x = 19 are the same off-screen cell.

Timers are not in info(); they are reconstructed from tick: a pill eaten during a step makes ghosts edible until
(step start tick) + 241, a ghost eaten during a step is harmless (and fast) until (step start tick) + 91; both use
the earliest tick of the step, the conservative side."""
